# Demo Fictional Company Website Miniproject

This is a simple miniproject I'm doing following a course on HTML & CSS ( [Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) by Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/) ).

The miniproject looks a bit basic and so to make it more interesting I decided to add a little challenge to myself, that is to implement the project using ReactJs (which I'm currently studying).

In the previous miniproject I did ( [Demo Hotel Miniproject](https://github.com/dario-piotrowicz/ReactJS-CSS_demo_hotel_miniproject) ) the challenge was not to use the Create-React_App tool, JSX, Babel, Webpack, etc... (just playin HTML, CSS and Javascript)

This time I'm still not using CRA, but I want to use JSX, Babel and Webpack (and SASS). So the new challenge is to setup the whole react application up by myself and configuring manually the aforementioned tools.

Other aspect I'd like to mention is:
- All UI Designs and HTML/CSS are taken from the course and I'm coding along, so that is not designed by me, what is completely mine are the files structure and the aforementioned configration and react aspects
