# Demo Fictional Company Website Miniproject

This is a simple miniproject I'm doing following a course on HTML & CSS ( [Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) by Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/) ).

The miniproject looks a bit basic and so to make it more interesting I decided to add a little challenge to myself, that is to implement the project using ReactJs (which I'm currently studying).

In the previous miniproject I did ( [Demo Hotel Miniproject](https://github.com/dario-piotrowicz/ReactJS-CSS_demo_hotel_miniproject) ) the challenge was not to use the Create-React_App tool, JSX, Babel, Webpack, etc... (just playin HTML, CSS and Javascript)

This time I'm still not using CRA, but I want to use JSX, Babel and Webpack (and SASS). So the new challenge is to setup the whole react application up by myself and configuring manually the aforementioned tools.

\
Most of the UI designs and HTML/CSS are taken from the course, so that is not designed by me, what is 100% completely mine is the files structure, the aforementioned configration and the react aspects.
